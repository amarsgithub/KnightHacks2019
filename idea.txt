/*
This Arduino code is designed for use with the Origami Paper Robot.
It is designed to move the robot along a dark surface, avoiding light areas.
The code below:
-Turns on the LED
-Takes a reflection measurement of the current surface
-Flashes the LED
-Moves the robot forward until reflection is too light
-When the robot runs into an area that is too light it:
---moves backward briefly
---rotates back and forth for longer amounts of time until it finds a dark area
-The robot then continues forward.
